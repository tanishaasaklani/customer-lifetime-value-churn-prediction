# Customer Lifetime Value & Churn Prediction using XGBoost

This project uses **XGBoost** to solve two business problems from the same dataset:

- **Classification:** Predict whether a customer will churn  
- **Regression:** Predict how much revenue a customer is likely to generate

## Goal
To show how one algorithm can be applied to both classification and regression, and how choosing the right metric is more important than chasing high accuracy.

## What I Did
- Built customer-level features from transaction data  
- Trained XGBoostClassifier for churn prediction  
- Trained XGBoostRegressor for revenue prediction  
- Evaluated models using appropriate metrics  
- Visualized results with confusion matrix, actual vs predicted plot, and feature importance

## Results

**Regression Performance**
- MAE: 485.99  
- R² Score: 0.39  

## Learning

- XGBoost works well for both problem types  
- Metrics must match the business objective  
- The same dataset can answer multiple questions
